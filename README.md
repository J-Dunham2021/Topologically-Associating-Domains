Repository containing the code for my Master's thesis -  It’s a TAD Complicated:  Detecting Genomic Structural Alterations Using TAD Delineated Gene Expression Data

Code is not from a professional coder, but it gets the job done on what was needed for the data at the time. 
Thesis Committee/supervisors:

Kimberly J. Bussey, Ph.D.,
Michelle Mancenido,
Sreethan Kanthaswamy,

The data from the thesis contains resources/information from websites such as:

Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) from the NCBI website
UCSC Genome Table Browser
CellMiner (NCI60) 
ENCODE Project website
PCAWG Structural Variation Working Group, PCAWG Consortium, Akdemir KC, Le VT, Chandran S, Li Y, et al. Disruption of chromatin folding domains by somatic genomic rearrangements in human cancer. Nat Genet. 2020 Mar;52(3):294–305.
